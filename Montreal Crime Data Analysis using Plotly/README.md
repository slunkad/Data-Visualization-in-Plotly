# Montreal Crime Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed Montreal city crime data (2015 - 2017) with a goal of providing solutions to the key questions among other findings noted in the analysis like:

1. What are the top 3 prevalent crimes or offenses committed in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in Montreal City?

2. Which neighborhoods recorded the highest crime incidents in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and what are the crime types in these neighborhoods?

3. Which top 5 police stations (PDQ) got the most crime complaints in 2015, 2016 and 2017?
