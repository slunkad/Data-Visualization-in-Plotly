# Stock Price Comparison using Plotly

This project shows two different plots. 

The scatter plot presents historical stock price comparison of three companies, Apple, Amazon and Google. 

You can choose what price you want to see using the radio buttons above the plot.

The second plot shows the volume of sales in different years. Again, you can choose a year (between 2015 to 2019) to play around.

Currently, this project runs on a local environment. You can choose the index/ year in the python code
